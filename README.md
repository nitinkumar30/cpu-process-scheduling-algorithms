# Language used

> I've implemented in Python 🐍 but you may contribute in other language. For more details on how to contribute, please refer [here](https://github.com/avinash201199/Hacktoberfest-Guide/blob/main/How%20to%20begin%20with%20hacktober%20fest%202021/README.MD#how-to-raise-an-issue-before-raising-pr).

# How to run

> You may use either of 2 ways:
> 1. Locally in your computer by installing Python >2.7 [preferrablly 3.9.5]
> 2. Online IDE like [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/), [onlinegdb.com](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler) etc.
